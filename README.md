# Create-React-App Bootstrap v5 sass starter

I decided to whip together a [Bootstrap v5 alpha starter](https://github.com/jcameronjeff/cra-twbs5-starter) to begin exploring and following the changes in the popular framework. Read their announcement on the [Bootstrap Blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/).

This starter uses bootstrap @v5.0.0-alpha. node-sass, and yarn 2. I went with yarn 2 since this starter isn't meant for production use.

I'll try to update and add more options as bootstrap 5 progresses.

For more information on the changes to the framework and compoonents, see the v5 [docs](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).

**Note: this project is stable on node 12.**

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jcameronjeff/cra-twbs5-starter.git`

2. Install dependencies: `cd cra-twbs5-starter && yarn install`

3. Start the app: `yarn start`

### Customizing bootstrap

Add sass variables to ./src/scss/variables.scss to start customizing bootstrap.

For a full list of variables, see https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v5.0.0-alpha1/scss/_variables.scss.
